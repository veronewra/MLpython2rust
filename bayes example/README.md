Methodology \n
The Rust and Python programs in this folder do the exact same process on the same data in order to compare the languages. \n
I used the command line tool 'hyperfine' to benchmak the two programs. \n
Note that for benchmarking I ran the linfa_bayes binary file since that is closer to how the code would be used in production.\n
(Including cargo/ build in the hyperfine benchmark still yeilds Rust being many times faster) \n
[TODO] insert screenshot of my results \n
Specs of the computer that was used: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz\n
Results will vary based on your computer and the tasks its running. \n\n

I'd appreciate any and all feedback or follow-ups!
